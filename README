A simple HTTP proxy server in Haskell. This proxy server doesn't do any caching,
and doesn't do much integrity checking of incoming requests or of server replies,
so it shouldn't be used anywhere where the client can't trust all servers they
connect to.

Purpose: test-proxy is designed to be a really simple proxy server implementation
that developers can modify to test clients and web applications - the proxy can
be modified to modify requests and / or replies to carry out custom tests.
